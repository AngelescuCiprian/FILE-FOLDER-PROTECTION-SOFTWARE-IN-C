File/Folder Protection Software

Description

This is a simple command-line utility written in C that allows users to hide and unhide files or folders on their system. It was originally designed for Turbo C++ but may require modifications to work on modern compilers.

Features

Hide any file or folder

Unhide previously hidden files or folders

Simple text-based user interface

Requirements

Turbo C++ (or an alternative compiler with support for <conio.h> and <dos.h>, though modifications may be needed for modern systems)

Compilation and Usage

Open Turbo C++.

Load the source code file (FOLDERPR.c).

Compile and run the program.

Follow the on-screen instructions to hide or unhide files/folders.

Compatibility

Designed for Turbo C++ on DOS-based systems.

May not work on modern Windows/Linux without modifications.

Notes

_chmod is used for setting file attributes, which may need an alternative approach on modern compilers.
